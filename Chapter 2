- Rationality
What is rational at any given time depends on four things:
The performance measure that defines the criterion of success.
The agent’s prior knowledge of the environment.
The actions that the agent can perform.
The agent’s percept sequence to date.

1. Task environment:  The nature of the task
environment directly affects the appropriate design for the agent program.

2. Four basic kinds of agent programs that embody
    the principles underlying almost all intelligent systems:
                Simple reflex agents;
                Model-based reflex agents;
                Goal-based agents; and
                Utility-based agents.
3. Model-based agent
    The transition model and sensor model allow an agent to keep track of the state of
the world—to the extent possible given the limitations of the agent’s sensors. An agent that
uses such models is called a model-based agent.
